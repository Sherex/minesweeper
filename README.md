## How to use
Can be either played or used as a lib.
### Play
```sh
git clone https://github.com/sherex/minesweeper
cd minesweeper
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
Use the arrowkeys to move around the grid, enter to open the cell and space to flag.

You can also use `node dist/bin/cli-input.ts` to use a prompt based interaction. (for ex. `f2,3` or `o4,3`)
